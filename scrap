if error occurs anywhere:
    Video Data
    Show all Clips
    Option to filter valid clips from not valid clips
    for all clips(especially invalid), the option exists to:
        see all of its data
        re do the base image generation
        modify voice script
        re do the voice over generation
        re do the merge audio and visuals

    For video itself, we can recall:
        # re dos
        generate_base_images
        generate_voice_overs


        # new functionality
        merge only valid ones we have so far


WE need a button that will populate the ui with default values
